Creating a virtual machine involves three main steps. First, a hypervisor or virtualization software is installed on a physical host computer. Then, the virtual machine configuration is defined, specifying factors such as the desired operating system, hardware resources, and network settings. Finally, the hypervisor creates the virtual machine by allocating resources from the host computer and emulating the desired hardware environment, enabling the virtual machine to function as a self-contained and isolated entity within the host system.

Creating an osTicket via remote desktop involves two steps. Firstly, establish a remote desktop connection to the server where osTicket will be installed. Then, access the server's operating system remotely and proceed with the osTicket installation process, configuring the necessary settings and database connectivity to set up the ticketing system.
